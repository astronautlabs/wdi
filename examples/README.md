This directory contains a simple Typescript example that demonstrates how to use the [reference implementation](https://github.com/astronautlabs/wdi/blob/master/wdi/README.md) for [WDI](https://github.com/astronautlabs/wdi). The example includes both client and server components.

This example implements a rudimentary WDI->RTMP gateway for demonstration purposes.
