WDI (the Web Device Interface) is a client/server media transport scheme 
based on WebRTC and WebSockets, this is the reference implementation for that 
specification. It can be used to easily add WDI support to any Javascript 
or Typescript app, both in the browser and on the server using Node.js.

# Usage in the Browser

For the browser, it is sufficient to just install the reference implementation:

```
npm install @astronautlabs/wdi
```

Within the package you will find a class called `WDIClient` that lets you easily
establish connections to WDI servers (via WebSockets and WebRTC).

```typescript
let client = new WDIClient(`wss://mywdiserver.example.com:1234/path`);
await client.addStream(someMediaStream);
await client.connect();
```

You can also pass arbitrary metadata with your stream.

```typescript
await client.addStream(someMediaStream, {
  yourDataHere: 123
});
```

For convenience, you can pass a URL as the identity parameter 
instead. 

```typescript
await client.addStream(someMediaStream, 'https://example.com/');
```

WDI will expand this into a `StreamIdentity` object like so:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/"
}
```

Note that WDI itself assigns no special meaning to the identity data passed 
alongside a stream. The meaning needs to be agreed upon between the client and 
server applications.

WDI servers can also forward streams to the client. You can listen for incoming 
streams:

```typescript
client.remoteStreamAdded.subscribe(identifiedStream => {
  let stream : MediaStream = identifiedStream.stream;
  // do something with the stream
});
```

The API for sending and receiving streams is isomorphic; it works the same on the 
server as on the client. Both sides can also request that a new stream be delivered.

```typescript
client.acquireStream(identityMetadata)
```

You can receive acquired streams by listening to `remoteStreamAdded`, or by awaiting
the promise returned by `acquireStream`

```typescript
let identifiedStream = await client.acquireStream(identityMetadata);
```

Conceptually, `acquireStream` just sends a simple message to the server. It is 
then up to the server to produce and forward a stream to send back to the client 
for that request. 

# Usage on the Server

In addition to WDI itself, you will need implementations for WebRTC and 
WebSockets. We recommend `wrtc` (based on Google's `libwebrtc`) and 
`ws`, but you can use any standards compliant implementations.

```
npm install @astronautlabs/wdi wrtc ws
```

You'll need to ensure that the `RTCPeerConnection` class from your chosen
implementation is available in the global scope before trying to use WDI.

```typescript
import { RTCPeerConnection } from 'wrtc';
global['RTCPeerConnection'] = RTCPeerConnection;
```

Your server application will be responsible for accepting incoming `WebSocket` 
sessions and passing them to an instance of `WDIServer`. 

```typescript
import { WDIServer } from '@astronautlabs/wdi';
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';

// Construct a WDI server instance and subscribe 
// to incoming remote streams. 

const wdiServer = new WDIServer();
wdiServer.remoteStreamAdded.subscribe(async identifiedStream => {
  let stream : MediaStream = identifiedStream.stream;
  // do something with the stream (perhaps guided by identifiedStream.identity)
});

// Start a WebSocket server and pass clients to the WDI server
new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3000 })
  .addListener('connection', socket => wdiServer.accept(<any>socket))
;

```
For metadata sent alongside the stream from the client,
see `identifiedStream.identity`. 

The types of things you can do with the MediaStream depends on the WebRTC 
implementation you have selected. The `wrtc` package offers a set of classes
that let you send/receive raw audio/video data from streams sent over WebSockets.
For that, see `RTCVideoSink`, `RTCVideoSource`, `RTCAudioSink`, `RTCAudioSource`.

Note that operations on video frames (especially 1080p and up) are expensive, you
should take care to minimize unnecessary copies or frame transformations. For 
more information see [Performance](#Performance).

# Handling `acquireStream` requests

You can handle `acquireStream` requests (see above) on both clients and servers 
by subclassing `WDIClient` and/or `WDIServer` and implementing `provideStream`:

```typescript
protected async provideStream(identity : StreamIdentity): Promise<NonNullable<MediaStream>>;
```

If your application can provide a stream that matches the given identity (however
you decide to interpret it), return it and the stream will be automatically returned
across WebRTC to the requestor. 

If your application cannot service the request, throw an error. WDI will catch 
the error and send it back to the client, where it will be cause the promise 
returned by `acquireStream()` to reject/throw.

# Performance

The reference implementation is very small and does none of the heavy lifting.
The performance you observe will be heavily dependent on what you do with the 
media streams being sent/received. 

## Transforming Video Frames

Raw video frames at modern resolutions are very large. Copying, converting, 
scaling and rotating video frames efficiently requires use of the host CPU's 
SIMD (single input, multple destination) instructions, or at least a highly 
optimized naive implementation. The easiest way to achieve this is to offload 
frame manipulation to WebAssembly (in the browser) and native C/C++/Rust addons 
(on Node.js).

The included server example utilizes 
[Astronaut Labs' `libyuv` NPM package](https://github.com/astronautlabs/libyuv-node), 
a native add-on for Node.js that exposes Chromium's `libyuv` library.
Chromium's `libyuv` is written in C++ and implements SIMD on x64, ARM and MIPS.
`libyuv` provides color space conversions, scaling, and rotation routines for 
raw video frames, like the kind produced by `wrtc`.
